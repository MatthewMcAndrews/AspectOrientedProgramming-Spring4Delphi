# AspectOrientedProgramming-Spring4Delphi
An Example of Aspect Oriented Programming in Delphi Using the Spring4D Library

This project requires the [Spring4D](https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/spring4d) framework.

I have found this sort of thing useful when using constructor injection.
Combineed with the [CLMR](https://github.com/MatthewMcAndrews/command-line-method-runner) project, this can make for a lean console app.
